    "comment": "If the person does not know or remember the answer to the question (but you asked the question), then you record -9 (minus 9) to indicate that the respondent (or the researcher) “does not know”. Naturally, one should aim to minimize the use of this response, but in some cases it is unavoidable"

    "comment": "If a response on the data sheet needs a code, but does not yet have one, record -10 (minus 10), and the name of the item to be coded in the column “notes” (this will make it easier for the cleaning phase). Later, the -10 will be replaced by the new code for that response/item. If a value is missing (the person is away and you could not ask the question, or you forgot to ask it), then you should leave the cell blank. Missing values must be replaced with real values, so if you forgot to ask a question, return as soon as possible to collect the missing data, or if the person was away, collect the data upon his or her return"

This is done to clearly distinguish between these answers (-8, -9) and any regular answer"
