  "village": "For purposes of LICCI research a village/community is defined as the lowest administrative unit in an area, normally under the jurisdiction of a village leader/council. In some contexts a village can be very large, i.e., several thousand households, while in others it can be rather small, i.e., 20 households.  \n" +

    "Using villages with very different sizes across the LICCI project can cause some biases when it comes to comparing them. If the “villages” typically have more than 500-1000 households one should consider breaking it up into smaller units and sample one or a few of them. The selection of villages should be done in coordination with the LICCI Core Team."
