  "about.1p1": "This is the first public release of the OPENTEK app.  OPENTEK is a free and open source platform to document and share Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) related to biodiversity and climate change impacts. OPENTEK is designed as a progressive web-app (PWA) allowing users both to visualize existing geolocalized data and to collect new data. OPENTEK will be linked to two innovative citizen science projects documenting Indigenous and local knowledge around the world: CONECT-e (www.conecte.es) and LICCI (www.licci.eu). CONECT-e gathers and shares TEK related to plants and landraces, including traditional uses, management and local names. To address the local nature of TEK, the information entered in CONECT-e is geo-localized and can be visualized through maps. The information is also reviewed by a group of editors (i.e., scientists and TEK experts) and protected from misappropriation through a Creative Commons copyleft license[1]. LICCI gathers and shares information on local indicators of climate change impacts (e.g., changes in rainfall patterns or impacts of weather changes on wild animal abundance) under a structured format that will allow cross-site comparisons.",

We delete IP addresses after 30 days. In addition, when a mobile application uses our SDKs to access our APIs, it may send us certain limited location and usage data along with an ephemeral ID. We delete this ephemeral ID within 24 hours and do not associate it or the unprocessed mobile location data with any personally identifying information, including names, permanent IDs, email addresses, IP addresses, or phone numbers. We also collect randomly-generated IDs for the limited purpose of analyzing the use of our APIs, including the number of active users. We will delete the randomly generated IDs and the content of requests made to our APIs after 36 months.",
